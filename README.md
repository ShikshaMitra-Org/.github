## 👥 Our Team Culture

At **GyanMirai**, we're not just colleagues — we're more like **family**, and we truly mean it.  

We work together, laugh together, argue for better outcomes, and push one another like you'd push your younger sibling to grow. If you don’t have that kind of drive — to call out mistakes with care, to uplift others with honesty — then you probably don’t belong here.

We value:
- **Radical honesty** over fake harmony  
- **Doing the right thing** over doing things for appearance  
- **Pushing each other forward** rather than dragging anyone down  

Everyone here leads something important. We don't believe in rigid hierarchies — we believe in **accountability, collaboration, and growth**.
